# AI Conversation Assistant
This project, `AI Conversation Assistance`, aims to provide an intelligent conversation assistant using advanced AI models. 
The application uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to assist in generating meaningful and context-aware responses for a variety of use cases, including customer support, personal assistants, and more.


## Features

- **Speech-To-Text**: Speech-to-Text (STT) is a technology that converts spoken language into written text, allowing users to input information through speech rather than manual typin
- **Text-To-Speech**: The Text-to-Speech (TTS) module converts text into natural and smooth speech output, providing audio feedback to enhance accessibility and interactivity
- **Customizable**: You can use the knowledge base or the Google search engine
- **OpenAI API Integration**: The system uses the OpenAI API for generating conversation responses.
- **Autogen**: Autogen function serves as the automated generation engine for the RAGFlow project. Autogen enables real-time knowledge retrieval and customizable search option to support project objectives.
- **Memory**: The memory function enables the system to maintain context across multiple interactions
- **Evaluation**:By adopting these evaluation metrics, the module provides a comprehensive analysis of response quality and optimizes system output to enhance accuracy, ultimately improving the user experience.
